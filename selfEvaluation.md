# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel ok about the for statements, still trying to understand how I can apply them to solve different problems.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

It was tough to go back and see how thinks build block but after I understood how it all kinda came togther it was much easier. I struggled both productive and unproductive struggle.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to practice using the different methods and properties properly. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? 
 why we use the property .length vs. another one?
